A favicon is a small icon associated with a website or webpage. The term "favicon" is a blend of "favorite" and "icon." Favicons are typically displayed in various parts of web browsers to help users identify and distinguish between different websites. Common locations for favicons include the browser's address bar, tabs, and bookmarks.

Here are some key points about favicons:

Size and Format: Favicons are usually square images with dimensions like 16x16 pixels or 32x32 pixels.
Common image formats for favicons include ICO (Windows icon), PNG, and GIF.
Placement: Favicons appear in the browser's address bar, next to the website's URL.
They also show up in browser tabs when a user has multiple tabs open.
Bookmarked pages often display the favicon as well.
Branding: Favicons are a part of a website's branding, providing a recognizable visual element that helps users associate the icon with a specific website.
Implementation: To add a favicon to a website, a small icon file (e.g., favicon.ico) is typically included in the root directory of the website.
HTML code is added to reference the favicon file, ensuring that browsers can retrieve and display it.
